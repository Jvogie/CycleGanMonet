# CycleGAN Monet Paintings

This Jupyter notebook provides a step-by-step guide to implement and train a Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) to generate paintings in the style of Claude Monet.
 Content Overview:

    Load Data: Preprocess and prepare the dataset for the training process.
    Build the generator and discriminator: Set up the architecture for the two main components of the GAN.
    Build the CycleGAN model: Combine the generator and discriminator to form the complete CycleGAN model.
    Define loss functions: Establish the loss functions that will guide the training of the CycleGAN.
    Train CycleGAN: Launch the training process using the defined models and loss functions.

Usage:

To run the notebook, ensure you have all the necessary libraries installed. Then, open the notebook in Jupyter and execute the cells sequentially.
